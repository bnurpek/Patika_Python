## Flatten

I wrote a function that accepts list inputs which has different type of elements include lists too and returns list as output which has no list as elements.

- isinstance(element, list) is a function to check element is list or not. If it's list then isinstance function return True else return False.

To Turkish explanation of isinstance [click here](https://www.pythontr.com/makale/python-isinstance-fonksiyonu-684)

For example,
-Input: [[1,'a',['cat'],2],[[[3]],'dog'],4,5] 
-Output: [1,'a','cat',2,3,'dog',4,5]

## Reverse of list

I wrote a function that accepts list inputs and return reverse of list and also reverse of its list elements.

- I also use isinstance to reach all inside lists.

For example,
-Input: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6, 7]]
-Output: [[7, 6, 5], [4, 3], [2, 1]]
